//---------- Background colours --------------
// $backgrounds define 2 things: (starting-class-name, value)
// If you need a black background you need to use the class: black-bg
// If you need to use a colour background which is not here just add at the end of $background following the previous example.

$backgrounds: (black, #000),
				(white, #fff),
				(primary, $primary),
				(secondary, $secondary),
				(light-grey, $light-grey) ;

@each $id, $color in $backgrounds {
	.#{$id}-bg {
		background: $color;
	}
}
